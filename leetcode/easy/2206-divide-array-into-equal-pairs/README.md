# Divide Array Into Equal Pairs

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You are given an integer array `nums` consisting of `2 * n` integers.

You need to divide `nums` into `n` pairs such that:

- Each element belongs to exactly one pair.
- The elements present in a pair are equal.

Return `true`  *if nums can be divided into*  `n`  *pairs, otherwise return*  `false`.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: nums = [3,2,3,2,2,2]
Output: true
Explanation: 
There are 6 elements in nums, so they should be divided into 6 / 2 = 3 pairs.
If nums is divided into the pairs (2, 2), (3, 3), and (2, 2), it will satisfy all the conditions.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
Explanation: 
There is no way to divide nums into 4 / 2 = 2 pairs such that the pairs satisfy every condition.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- nums.length == 2 * n
- 1 <= n <= 500
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 500

    public boolean divideArray(int[] nums) {
        
        Arrays.sort(nums);

        for(int i=0;i<nums.length-1;i=i+2)
        {
            if(nums[i]!=nums[i+1])
            {
                return false;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
}
```
