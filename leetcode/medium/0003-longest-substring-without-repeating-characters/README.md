# Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given a string `s`, find the length of the  **longest**   **substring**  without duplicate characters.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. Note that "bca" and "cab" are also correct answers.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 0 <= s.length <= 105
- s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

```java
class Solution 
{
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) 
    {
        int maxLen=0;
        for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++)
        {
            HashSet<Character> set = new HashSet<>();

            for(int j=i;j<s.length();j++)
            {
                char ch=s.charAt(j);

                if(set.contains(ch))
                {
                    break;
                }

                set.add(ch);

                maxLen=Math.max(maxLen,j-i+1);

            }
        }

        return maxLen;
        
    }
}
```
